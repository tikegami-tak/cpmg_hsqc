Each folder saves a pulse programs (beginning with ti) and parameter files (Topspin 3.6.2). The 4 folders correspond to the 4 types of CPMG methods, respectively. These are the data when measured by Burker 500 MHz NMR (BBO probe), but the parameters for a cryo-probe are almost the same except for 13C and 1H RF powers.

First, assemble the pulse program portion of the CPMG period using the ti13Ccpmg_hsqc4.pl program. Then, paste the output into the specified location in the pulse program ti13Ccpmg_hsqc*.

I'll continue soon.
